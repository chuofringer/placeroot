"""Shared DuckDB connection management for the query layer.

This is the one place that configures a connection (httpfs, object cache,
S3 timeouts/retries) and loads the spatial extension; every theme module
(overture, routing, divisions, buildings) goes through it.

Concurrency (issue #24): conn_lock serializes every use of shared_conn(),
since DuckDB connections aren't safe for concurrent execute() calls.
Background tile materialization (cache.py) is the one exception, by
design: it always runs on its own connection via new_connection().

overture._conn/overture._conn_lock remain as thin aliases to shared_conn/
conn_lock (deprecated in favor of importing db directly) so existing
external references — tests included — keep working unchanged.
